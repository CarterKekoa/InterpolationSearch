## Project Part 2
For this step, you must submit a short project update. Describe what progress you have made and whether any of your initial plans have changed (from step 1). Instructions for your submission will be provided via Piazza. Note that a special “Project” repository will made available for you via Github classroom to turn in your status report, code, and final report (see below).
### Interpolation Search
At this point in the project I have most of the base files set up. I have a simple version of Interpolation search working at the moment which I would consider good progress. I'm hopping to begin researching and writing a raboust set of examples to run my algorithm on and run a performance evaluation on. Originally I hopped to write the algorithm in python, however as I was making progress I moved away from this idea in order to make it easier on myself to write GTests that align with the class. Also, I initially had wanted to do a chess solving algorithm, however do to its likeness with other students work I had to work to find another algorithm to work with and somehow ended on interpolation. All in all, the project is going well so far.
